# MA-562-Python-Programming-Projects
Project #1: Python code for the old number game, Bulls and Cows, described below:
Each of two players selects 4 digits to make up a number. 
The number contains no digit repetition. T
he number could start with zero, for instance "0539" is a valid choice. 
The purpose of the game is to take turns guessing your opponent's number, as follows:
Let's pretend that player 1 choice is indeed "0539", then player 2 might try to start the game by guessing "0123". 
Player 1 must then provide the following feedback: "1 Cow - 1 Bull". 
The "cow" corresponds to number 3 that IS in player 1's number, but it is not in the correct position. 
The "bull" corresponds to the number zero which was guessed correctly, that is, the correct digit in the right position. 
Players should write down the corresponding feedback from each guess so that each new guess is based on prior information. 
The player who guesses its opponent number first wins!


Project #2: Each year, the Lawrenceville School awards two academic cups to Houses:
Green Cup: Awarded to the Circle or Crescent House who has the largest GPA increase between the fall and spring terms
Chivers Cup: Awarded to the Circle or Crescent House who has the highest cumulative GPA
Project #2 presents a program that finds the top three Lawrenceville School houses in each category given an excel spreadsheet including 
grade data from the 2021 school year. Included data cleaning and file reading/writing in python. 



Project #3: Using Tkinter Graphical User Interface (GUI), project #3 is a python script for an interactive, two-player tic tac toe game. The objective of the game is the first person to get three X's or O's across, down, or diagnol a 3x3 grid with alternating turns between X's and O's.
