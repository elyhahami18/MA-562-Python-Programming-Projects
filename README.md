Python code for the old number game, Bulls and Cows, described below:
Each of two players selects 4 digits to make up a number. 
The number contains no digit repetition. T
he number could start with zero, for instance "0539" is a valid choice. 
The purpose of the game is to take turns guessing your opponent's number, as follows:
Let's pretend that player 1 choice is indeed "0539", then player 2 might try to start the game by guessing "0123". 
Player 1 must then provide the following feedback: "1 Cow - 1 Bull". 
The "cow" corresponds to number 3 that IS in player 1's number, but it is not in the correct position. 
The "bull" corresponds to the number zero which was guessed correctly, that is, the correct digit in the right position. 
Players should write down the corresponding feedback from each guess so that each new guess is based on prior information. 
The player who guesses its opponent number first wins!
